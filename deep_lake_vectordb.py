    review= "The AuraGlow Sleep Mask is a reliable option for minimizing light disruption during sleep. Its contoured design, particularly around the nose bridge, effectively reduces ambient light, even in brighter environments. The adjustable strap ensures a comfortable and secure fit, accommodating various head sizes without slippage.  The mask is made from a soft modal blend, which breathes well and prevents overheatingâ€”a common complaint with some sleep masks.  The stitching appears durable, and after several weeks of use, there are no signs of wear. While it doesn't offer noise cancellation, its light-blocking and comfort make it a worthwhile choice for improving sleep quality. 4/5 stars."
